Change the default behavior of WordPress to generate passphrases, not passwords.

== Description ==

Are you tired of generating gibberish for your passwords? While the default passwords created by WordPress may be
mathematically secure, they aren't very user friendly.

There has been a big push in the security industry to using passphrases instead of passwords, and this plugin will let
you do just that when you create new access credentials for your users.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-generate-passphrase` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP
1. Alternatively, upload the `wp-generate-passphrase_v#.#.zip` file to the 'Plugins->Add New' page in your WordPress admin
area
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I know if this plugin is working? =

You can test the passphrase generation capabilities on the plugin's Settings screen itself to see what types of
passphrases are output from the system. To see it in action, you can go to the WordPress User admin tools to Add or Edit
a user. When clicking the `Generate Password` button you will see a passphrase in the password box instead of the default
12-character Alphanumeric+symbols password that is typically generated.

= What is a passphrase? Is it really better than a password? =
[https://xkcd.com/936/]

And yes, when you consider the user experience a passphrase is much better than a randomly generated sequence.

= Are passphrases secure? =
It depends entirely on the specific passphrase you use and the type of attack launched on your system, but the short
answer is "probably yes". Using this plugin's default settings, the passphrases created *are* mathematically less secure
than the default passwords created by WordPress.

However, consider the following: passphrases generated by this plugin will be anywhere from 12 to 36+ characters long.
If an attacker knows the entire dictionary of words in use (7,776 words long) and is able to launch an attack which makes
1,000 login attempts per second, it would take that attacker approximately 11,566,152 years to iterate over every
passphrase permutation available. If a "dumb" brute-force attack tried to crack your passphrase, it would anywhere from
6.6 years (for the shortest, 12-character passphrase) to 60,261,948,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000+ years (for a
36-character passphrase) to iterate every single passphrase available.

Using the advanced options of the plugin will also allow you to create stronger passphrases by adding symbols, numerics,
and allow you to use custom word lists for generating your passphrases.

= What else can I do to secure my User accounts? =
Use Two-Factor Authentication if you have a serious concern regarding account security. I cannot recommend this strongly
enough. Use 2FA. Do it.

If you are interested in finding a WP plugin to use 2FA, I recommend
[looking through the repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/2-factor-authentication/) or
[searching Google](https://www.google.com).
